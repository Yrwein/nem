Aka no-name network manager (n3m) for Linux.

This project is just for me to learn sth about networks, python and possibly other stuff. Also it helps me survive increasingly common failures of default Ubuntu network manager to connect to wifi. :)

Current features:

 * List wireless networks
 * Connect to wifi via WPA
